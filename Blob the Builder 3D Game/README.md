# 3D Game
Blob the Builder is a fantasy, third person side-scroller game where the Player is a mystical blob that is in a brick structure trying to collect building blocks. The Player must dodge the moving lava structures as they stand in the way. Also, there are bumps that the Player must jump over in order to collect the building blocks. Unfortunately, not all building blocks are great as there is a mysterious, partially transparent building block that will hinder the process. Survive for 30 seconds and collect as many building blocks as you can.

# Game Instructions
Controls use the general wasd controls where:
    a indicates the blob to rotate left
    d indicates the blob to rotate right
    w indicates the blob the move forward
    space indicates the blob to jump
The blob is only allowed one life. The object that can destroy the blob are the lava blocks that move back and forth on the bumps of the level.
In Blob the Builder, building blocks randomly spawn all over the level. There are three different kinds of building blocks. One of the is the normal block which is green and that increases the score by 1. Another of is the really good block which is a magenta-purple color and increases the score by 3. Last but not least, the transluscent purple block decreases the score by 1.

# Assets
Blob the Builders 3D model was made on Blender. His animations were created on Blender as well.
I used some free texture packs from the Unity Asset store as well and those include "Stylized Lava Texture" and "15 Original Bricks Textures"
The audio that plays on the main menu was created by hand using the Bosca Ceoil application. The other audio clips were taken online from free royalty-free sources
The typeface that was used, "Arial", was the generic typeface offered by Unity.

# Known bugs and deficiencies
The aspect ratio for my menu is not correct. I tried adjusting them to it's appropriate spots but it always ended up looking like how it does now.

# Rijecka
The Thunder Thighs game production all worked on the game together and sent all the proper code, assets, and files to Kosuke Takahashi to commit onto the Rijecka repository. Hence why there is only one person committing to the repository.
