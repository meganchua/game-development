I used all original artwork and created it in an application called Procreate.

The character generator works by clicking play and inputting all the fields.

You can roll for the abilities by clicking on the dice. The output of the rolls shows in the output field.

By clicking save, the json output will show in the output field. The json output is cutoff but you can
copy and paste it to see the json output.

By clicking quit, it will end the game stat.

All of my code is inside of "Output.cs".
