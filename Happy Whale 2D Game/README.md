CS 583 2D Game: Happy Whale

Inspiration: Mash up of the games Whale Trails and Flappy Bird
Artwork: All artwork was created by me through the application Procreate
Sound Effects: Created by me through the application BFXR
Scripts: Taken from Unity tutorials and the Unity website, and Side Scroller
scripts from youtube which I will cite on the Game Design Document

Instructions on how to play:
Press the space bar to dodge the evil jellyfish that will sting you! Avoid the
coral down below.
Try the Easy level for a slower-paced game, then work your way towards the
hard level which includes an evil whale that is also trying to kill you.
